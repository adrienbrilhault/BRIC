Description: The BRIC algorithm searches for the different clusters through three principal steps: 
  - BOOTSTRAP: a recursive depth (or convex body minimizers) trimming to locate a 
  first central location estimate.
  - REFINE: a two-pass outliers filtering, the first relying on euclidean distances 
  to the first estimate and unimodality tests, the second on robust distances and 
  multinormality tests.
  - ITERATE: after removing the samples selected in the REFINE step from the global 
  distribution, the same process is reapplied to search for additional clusters.
